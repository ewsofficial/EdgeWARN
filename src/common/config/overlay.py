"""Generic CLI > environment > YAML precedence resolution.

Works uniformly for booleans too: ``argparse.BooleanOptionalAction`` with
``default=None`` produces ``True``/``False``/``None`` (unset), so the same
``is not None`` check used for other types applies.

This module is the only place that parses an environment variable into a
configuration *value*. The one other environment read in the config layer is
``loader.config_root``'s ``EDGEWARN_CONFIG_DIR`` (``loader.py:155``), which selects
*which catalog to load* and so cannot come from a catalog; it is resolved before any
key exists and stays outside this precedence chain by necessity.
``plans/source-configuration-extraction-plan.md`` names
``synoptic/config.py``'s ``get_rap_max_age_minutes`` as the reference shape for
an override -- a named env-var constant, an unset test, and a ``ValueError``
that re-quotes the raw value -- while also requiring that no domain module parse
the environment itself. Those two only reconcile one way: the reference is a
description of the *semantics*, not of the location, so the semantics live here
and domain modules pass ``env_names=`` instead of reading ``os.environ``.
Concretely that means ``value_type`` for a key whose YAML value is ``null`` (so
there is no reference value to infer a type from), ``minimum`` for a bound that
was previously enforced by hand, and a message naming the variable rather than
the bare ``invalid literal for int()`` that ``int(raw)`` used to raise.

    both non-boolean flags (``default=None``) and boolean flags using
    ``argparse.BooleanOptionalAction`` (also ``default=None``).

    ``key`` is the dotted catalog path this value came from. When supplied, the
    winning layer is recorded for :func:`overrides`; a value resolved without it
    is simply absent from that report.

    ``value_type`` names the parse target when ``yaml_value`` is ``None`` and so
    cannot supply one. ``minimum`` rejects an out-of-range override instead of
    letting it through; both raise ``ValueError`` naming the variable.

    An environment variable that is set but blank counts as unset and the search
    continues. Exporting an empty value is how a shell or a compose file clears a
    setting, so a variable the operator believes is switched off must not make the
    process raise.

    Two of the three migrated sites already resolved a blank to the same answer
    they resolve it to now, by different routes: ``render.py`` tested
    ``if env_value:``, so a blank fell through to the catalog, and
    ``performance.py`` tested ``raw in {"1", "true", ...}`` after ``strip()``, so a
    blank was simply not truthy and the tracker stayed off -- which is still what
    happens, since the catalog's ``perf_tracker`` is ``null`` and the call site
    collapses that through ``bool()``. The RAP age override is the one that
    differed: it tested ``if raw_value is None``, so a blank reached ``int("")``
    and raised.
    Widening that one to "blank is unset" is an intended behavior change, not a
    side effect of the move; it is the only case where a value the old code
    rejected is now accepted, and ``test_overlay.py`` pins it at both the generic
    layer and the RAP site so a future tightening has to be deliberate.
