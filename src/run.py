"""Retired monolithic runner entry point.

``run.py`` previously owned EdgeWARN analysis plus EWMRS accessories and
NEXRAD in one process tree. That topology no longer exists, so forwarding this
command to only ``run_edgewarn.py`` would silently omit operational services.
Use the explicit service entry points (or ``run_all.py``) instead.
